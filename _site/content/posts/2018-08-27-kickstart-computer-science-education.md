Implementing a new core curriculum for Computer Science is a challenge. Adding twelve different optional modules is fun. The optional modules will be developed with the help of the bèta-support centers and with a lot of help from teachers. I'm attached to the development of networking & Internet of Things. It's been a great adventure and I learned a lot. A lot about new protocols, transmission rates, data packet sizes and most importantly I rediscovered the joy of learning.

Every school holiday I try to develop a new skill (ranging from speaking Swedish to Origami). It's fun to learn something new and I find it a great way to connect with my students. The fun and uncertainty of learning is something I really enjoy and it's the modus operandi for a lot of students. From frustration to understanding, discovering, applying and implementing. A lot of these aspects my students experience on a daily basis.

These are the modules almost production ready. The core curriculum is being developed at the educational publishers (Instruct, Informatica-actief & Enigma). I'm so proud of what we have achieved. This really is a great step and a good journey for computer science in the Netherlands. I'll update this blog when new teaching materials will be made available!
