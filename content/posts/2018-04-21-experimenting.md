# Eat, sleep, learn & repeat

Based on the song from Fat Boy Slim; [Eat, sleep, Rave & Repeat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w2kL_4vplU) this is a mantra that sticks. Experimenting!

Learning is what sets us apart from the Neandertal. We can cope with setbacks, a change in environment and the ability to learn from feedback.  In this short blog a few experiments to keep the mind busy, keep my employer happy, enjoy the benefits of being a Homosapien, to learn and share what is working!

## Develop a sense of excitement

How to develop a sense of excitement (or urgency) is the key to achieve greatness. The video below shows it all. Learning how to do a kickflip (5:47hrs) isn't a life skill, but it teaches so much about learning. I need to mention the article on Medium about the works of Papert ([Mindstorms: what did Papert argue and what does it mean for learning and education?](https://medium.com/bits-and-behavior/mindstorms-what-did-papert-argue-and-what-does-it-mean-for-learning-and-education-c8324b58aca4)). Learning how to do a kickflip on a skateboard isn't a life skill, but with the usage of the internet and learning from learning is key in developing excitement. For that purpose, I bought a skateboard and I am going to measure how long I need to develop the skill of using it as an alternative for a bike.

### How to develop a culture of experimenting?

- Start with communicating
- Fail **fast**, learn **fast**
- Make the skill applicable to a situation
    - Skateboarding can help with fighting off RSI
    - Counts as a workout
    - And helps alleviate stress
- Accept that you are not the expert, try to become the expert quickly
- Engage the skill with every fiber
    - Every ounce of bodyweight
        - Every kW of energy
- Jump in, head first!
- Push, boundaries are mostly only mentally

I´ve inspiration in the [Urge of excitement](https://www.urlaubsheld.de/magazin/artikel/the-urge-of-excitement-while-travelling) from a Globetrotter.

> Come on, why acclimate? We are globetrotters.

And the book [the lean startup](https://amzn.to/2Hiq0RR). It's a great book when starting to think in 'business terms'. Business can be broadly interpreted. It's way of thinking, developing and testing, product-centered, consumer-owned.
