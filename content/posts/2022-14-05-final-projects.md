# Final projects
This week my students graduated from computer science. These are a few pictures of of the projects. Later I'm planning an article about how to structure a final project. With a few guidelines and best practices.

## SENSE
This project is a repurposed ** Nerfgun ** with a [Huskeylens](https://wiki.dfrobot.com/HUSKYLENS_V1.0_SKU_SEN0305_SEN0336) to target students that are late in my classroom. The Nerfgun has received a chip upgrade and fires +/- 25-30% harder then with a stock Nerfgun. With the Stepper motor at the bottom the gun has the ability to track with 120 angle.
