The internet has changed us as a society. It has penetrated (almost) every aspect of our lives. Being online was a new outlet when I was young. I still hear my mother raising her voice when the telephone company sends its bill for the monthly usage. And still, I was allowed online. Under the supervision of my mother, who thought that it was a great invention at the time (1992/1993).

The internet is evolving in ways I cannot predict. But what I do know is that there is one commodity that isn't replenishable. It's a thing when you lost it, it's lost forever (or a very long time). Privacy and private thought. I've already implemented Cloudflare on my blog some time ago. And since a few weeks, I am using [Brave](https://brave.com/ram882). A new browser that claims that it was built around privacy. I do know that Safari is the default browser, but the support for extensions (I'm looking at you Grammarly) is terrible. It also isn't very battery friendly and with a daily commute of roughly 2,5 hours, battery life is life.

With my personal blog under the protection of Cloudflare, it's a logical step to also promote [Brave](https://brave.com/ram882). With a great businessmodel, you can also help my blog. With micro-donations via Brave, you not only support my blog but also help with the privacy-minded browser [Brave](https://brave.com/ram882). Go ahead, [install it](https://brave.com/ram882). **Every installation will help support my blog!**
