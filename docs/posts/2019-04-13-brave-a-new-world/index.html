        <p>The internet has changed us as a society. It has penetrated (almost) every aspect of our lives. Being online was a new outlet when I was young. I still hear my mother raising her voice when the telephone company sends its bill for the monthly usage. And still, I was allowed online. Under the supervision of my mother, who thought that it was a great invention at the time (1992/1993).</p>
<p>The internet is evolving in ways I cannot predict. But what I do know is that there is one commodity that isn&rsquo;t replenishable. It&rsquo;s a thing when you lost it, it&rsquo;s lost forever (or a very long time). Privacy and private thought. I&rsquo;ve already implemented Cloudflare on my blog some time ago. And since a few weeks, I am using <a href="https://brave.com/ram882">Brave</a>. A new browser that claims that it was built around privacy. I do know that Safari is the default browser, but the support for extensions (I&rsquo;m looking at you Grammarly) is terrible. It also isn&rsquo;t very battery friendly and with a daily commute of roughly 2,5 hours, battery life is life.</p>
<p>With my personal blog under the protection of Cloudflare, it&rsquo;s a logical step to also promote <a href="https://brave.com/ram882">Brave</a>. With a great businessmodel, you can also help my blog. With micro-donations via Brave, you not only support my blog but also help with the privacy-minded browser <a href="https://brave.com/ram882">Brave</a>. Go ahead, <a href="https://brave.com/ram882">install it</a>. <strong>Every installation will help support my blog!</strong></p>
