## What is it and how does it work?

This quick review of my unit starts off with a short story _"Numworks about Numworks"._  There is an [online simulator of Numworks](https://www.numworks.com/simulator/). It has all the same functions as the physical device.

> _Targeting a high school audience and competing with Texas Instruments' Ti-__nspire_ _family, the NumWorks calculator is equipped with a non-touch color LCD2._

> Translated from the [Wiki](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/NumWorks)

> _It offers a programmable interface in Python. Launched in France in the summer of 2017, the NumWorks calculator was quickly sold to several thousand students among French high schools, mainly thanks to a fine design, Python interface (programming language whose learning is mandatory in secondary education in France), the recommendations of many teachers and the creation of a community of users offering various applications online. The calculator is announced in open hardware ("open hardware", schemas and plans are available) and under open source with a Creative Commons BY-NC-ND4 license._

This is a calculator that has a great design and Python build into the OS. Updating is easy, just a modern webbrowser with webUSB. The device runs on a 100 MHz Cortex-M processor. It's lightning fast and the fun part... it runs Python! With software on [GitHub](https://github.com/numworks) and the community on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/numworks/) makes for an impressive online presence. Repair is easy! [The entire process in terms of hardware](https://www.numworks.com/resources/engineering/hardware/) is open source, The level of documentation is impressive. It's excellent. This is what documentation should look like. Did I already mentioned that it runs Python?

### Why do you need it

Great design, build with durability from the beginning and it can be upgraded. It has all the functions of a regular calculator and it can be programmed without much extra training.

#### What's the fun part?

It runs Python, had a USB connection and utilizes webUSB for updating. The calculator runs the core uPy and can be programmed with a computer. Or if you are up for a challenge... with the ABC-keyboard on the device. I've written a small script to return a random value of a dice.

## Code Example

The example can also be found [here](https://workshop.numworks.com/python/r-moorlag/test)

```
import random

#returns a number
def roll_dice():
  print (random.randint(1, 6))

print("""This python script returns a random value between 1 and 6. It's a dice""")

flag = True
while flag:
   user_prompt = input(">")
   if user_prompt.lower() == "quit":
      flag = False
   else:
     print("Rolling dice...\nYour number is:")
     roll_dice()
```
