# Introduction BadgerOS
Here is where the funs starts to happen. It's always a pleasure working with a product developed by Pimoroni. The documentation is always up to standards and the examples just work. In this example for a conference badge it's an easy 1 minute coding session to customise the badge. In the build-in **BadgerOS** there are a few working examples.
## BADGE.PY
Badge is a functional Badge for conferences and a great conversation starter. It comes with a build-in txt file that can be used updated without a lot of programming experience. Adding a personal touch with a picture needs a little skill with the command prompt.
This was very helpfull.
> The name badge image needs to be named 'badge-image.bin' and in the root directory of your Badger alongside badge.txt (not in the /images directory) **!!**
This image needs to be exactly 104 pixels in width and 128 pixels in height so you'll need to resize it with a graphics program like GIMP before you run it through the conversion script. When you come to convert it, don't use the --resize flag as this will stretch it to 296 x 128, instead use python3 convert.py --binary badge-image.png

Other examples include
- Checklist
With a small check if you cleared the item.
- Clock
Sadly not the best usecase for an e-paper display. With an update cycle of half a second it flashes a lot.
- E-Book
Fun to read a book (or small note) on a screen the size of a business card :-)
- Fonts
Example fonts on the device
- Image
- QR gen
- Launcher

#A hackable, programmable badge with E Ink¬Æ display, powered by Raspberry Pi RP2040.

In honour of Raspberry Pi's 10th birthday, we've fused a RP2040 microcontroller with an EPD display to make a stylishly monochrome, maker friendly, e-paper badge(r) to attach to your person, your office door or to prop up on your desk. With the support of the fun guys (and gals and non-binary pals) at Ineltek and Raspberry Pi we've been able to keep it as low cost as possible, hoorah!

![Badger](/img/badger.webp)

We've equipped Badger 2040 with plenty of buttons so you can easily change what's displayed on the screen, a slot so you can clip it onto a lanyard and a battery connector so you can keep things portable and refresh the screen whilst on the go. On the back, you'll find some funky badgerpunk stylings plus our RP2040 accoutrements of choice: boot and reset buttons and a Qw/ST connector so it's super easy to plug in Qwiic or STEMMA QT breakouts

Here are some things you could do with it!

- Switch between images, pronouns or secret identities at the push of a button
- Make yourself into a mobile weather station or air quality monitor (by adding a sensor breakout)
- Store important QR codes for getting into places (or to Rickroll people)
- Make a tiny to-do list and tick stuff off
- Display inspirational badger quotes or educational badger facts of the day
- Want to show your Badger the world? We've put together a convenient Badger + Accessory Kit which contains batteries, a lanyard and everything else that's needed to get portabello.
