# Yes, I love long reads

This is just a short blog about a page I started some time ago in draft mode. The long reads that keep me up at night, things I really want to read and that started a new way of seeing things.

I really love how these blogs redefine my (world)view and I try to convey that feeling in my classes computer science. Longs reads require an effort and a conviction to continue on reading. They challenge, perhaps even convert but mostly they can pinch a nerve. A few of my favorite long reads can be found in this blog. I'll keep a static page with all the hyperlinks to [the long reads on my website](http://ramonmoorlag.nl/bookshelf/reading-list/).
