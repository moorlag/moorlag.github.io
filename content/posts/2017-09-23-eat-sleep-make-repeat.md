# Reflections on EHVMMF

The day after...

## Friday - MakerED Meetup

Still, a bit impressed by the Eindhoven Maker Faire. Thanks to Arjan van de Meij I went to the Meetup on Friday; topic Maker Education. The power of making things and learning at the same time.

After a warm welcome by our host Arjan I really enjoyed the talk from René Pare. He is one of the organizers of the Maker Faire Eindhoven and he knows how to sell a story. What a fun guy!

[Anouk Wipprecht](http://www.anoukwipprecht.nl) made my day. What an energetic woman! Passioned and really witty. Her presentation was spot on and she showed us the way to draw outside the lines. Her 37 (!) dresses are all interactive and beautiful (sadly only size 37).
