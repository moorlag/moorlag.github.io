In this blog, I'll share some insights and tips when I organized Secret Santa. Sounds easy, doesn't it. Organizing Secret Santa with only superpowers. With my blog, I hope you can also use the superpowers I used to organize Secret Santa in 15 minutes. First I used Google Forms. This was a major thing. What information is helpful and gives a nice insight into the 'giftee'? With this experiment, I tried my first Add-On, and we are now in love. Add-ons make dull-tasks fun! (... or at least simpeler)

## The Secret Santa questions I used

- Name (yes, you need to ask)
- Email
- What makes you happy?
- What is your favorite color? (in a selection list)
- What is your lucky number?
- What is the maiden name of your mother (ow, wait this isn't a credit card hacking scam)
- How would you rate 2020?

## And then? How can I used the earlier mentioned Super Powers With YAMM?

With that list (**pro-tip** export it to a sheet) the fun starts. I used [YAMM](https://yet-another-mail-merge.com/) (Yet-another-Mail-Merge), free of usage with 50 mailmerges/day. Like any decent Mail-Merger, it used the first line as a guide. So the list is now used as a data collection; keep the titles simple; name, email, happy, color, number, 2020. I used the [documentation](https://support.yet-another-mail-merge.com/hc/en-us) a lot. An excellent example of good documentation. There are [free themed email templates](https://support.yet-another-mail-merge.com/hc/en-us/articles/210729589-Use-a-predesigned-template-from-our-gallery)! And now the fun continues. Do not only provide the 'gifter' with the data of the 'giftee'. Provide examples of gifts, suggestions for poems/nice letters and don't be afraid to write an example Haiku :-)

The << >> are the placeholders for the titles from the first line from the Sheet. <<User\_Name>> here is used. Notice the camelbacks; the Two Capitals? Be **very** consequent with capitals! Via Add-Ons in the Sheet. Easy right?
