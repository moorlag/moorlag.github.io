# Hi there

My name is Ramon Moorlag and this is my blog. My thanks goes out to Radek for this beauty of a template.

Serendipity is the one thing I have a firm believe in. Without that the following wouldn't have happened. ‚ù§Ô∏è

Co-founder Agora Roermond. üöÄA new school, with a new learning system based on the Agile framework, started a new curriculum computer science and having so much fun with teaching computer science (ds. Pierson College). ex-community manager and growth hacker at Leraar24.

Besides that I enjoy traveling, seeing the world, talking to people and tasting new cultures. And a firm believe in the continued development of people once they realize that living is learning. ü•≥

Have a problem that needs solving? Talk to me, I'm also self-employed.
