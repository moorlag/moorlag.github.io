# Cloudflare?

With the help of Cloudflare my blog is now HTTPS enabled and in case of a DDoS attack the service also can help manage the traffic. It's free! Cloudflare is a 'content delivery network' service. Basically is helps the web server to serve the website in a durable way to visitors (and prevents attackers from accessing the website).

## Implementing

During the implementation, I used the knowledge base a lot. Feel free to speed up the process of implementing with these links.

- [Cloudflare 101](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/categories/200275218)
- [How do I turn on DNSSEC?](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/212165728-How-do-I-turn-on-DNSSEC-)
- [How to add a DS record to Google Domains](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/209150908-How-to-add-a-DS-record-to-Google-Domains)
- [First Steps for all Cloudflare users](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/201897700-Step-4-Recommended-First-Steps-for-all-Cloudflare-users)
- [How do I redirect all visitors to HTTPS/SSL?](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200170536-How-do-I-redirect-all-visitors-to-HTTPS-SSL-)

It was really easy to start using Cloudflare. Together with Google Domains, it is easy to use and even easier to manage.

> Cloudflare, Inc. is a U.S. company that provides content delivery network services, DDoS mitigation, Internet security and distributed domain name server services, sitting between the visitor and the Cloudflare user's hosting provider, acting as a reverse proxy for websites.
