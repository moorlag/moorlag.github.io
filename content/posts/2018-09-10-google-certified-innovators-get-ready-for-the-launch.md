Last week I was surprised by the assignment of mentors. I was assigned a mentor for the Google Certified innovator program (see also my previous blog).Â 

The project I am working on is called '_are you still there_'. An interactive system to measure the growth of students in a fun way. Not a system to pursuit students, but a system to give insight into learning and the absence of that learning. Based on the activity system of Git. This is going to be so much fun!

It was fun talking to Anders from Sweden. He has a unique insight into the Swedish school system. He was a head teacher at a school for a few years, taught Geography and is now managing IT at a few schools.
