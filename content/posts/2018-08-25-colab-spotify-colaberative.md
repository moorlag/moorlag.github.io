Connecting with my students is something I really enjoy. One of my newest experiments is a collaborative playlist on Spotify. An easy way for students to send me tracks on Spotify.

With the greatest of care, they arranged a starting playlist with 25 tracks. And then things started to grow! Now with over 28 hours of music; 420 tracks and 38 followers I think I found a new way to interact with my students. I've added the occasional song, and the feedback was great. We are not just exchanging songs, we are having a conversation about music, mood improvements and life. **Life's for sharing.**
