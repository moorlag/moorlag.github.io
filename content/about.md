# Hi there

My name is Ramon Moorlag, and this is my blog. My thanks go out to Radek for this beauty of a template. Serendipity is the one thing I have a firm belief in. Without that, the following wouldn’t have happened. ❤️
Co-founder Agora Roermond. 🚀A new school, with a unique learning system based on the Agile framework, started a new computer science curriculum and had so much fun teaching computer science (ds. Pierson College). Ex-community manager and growth hacker at Leraar24.
Besides that, I enjoy traveling, seeing the world, talking to people, and tasting new cultures. And a firm believes in the continued development of people once they realize that living is learning. 🥳
Have a problem that needs solving? Talk to me; I’m also self-employed.
