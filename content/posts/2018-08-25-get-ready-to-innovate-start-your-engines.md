# Ladies, start your engines and may the best woman win. Get ready to innovate!

With the help of my students, I discovered [RuPaul's Drag race](https://twitter.com/logotv/). I think it gives an alternative view on how Americans see themselves and each other (and  Facebook has 70 (!) genders to choose from). I'm happy my students share these experiences with me. With a good connection, the learning happens almost automatically.

Innovation is just like gender; we are born with it and try to make the best of it. Innovation thrives with a cadence, a way of handling the process, an ideal system based on time or effort. And somehow RuPaul brings a smile to my face. **And now, lip-sync for your life.**
