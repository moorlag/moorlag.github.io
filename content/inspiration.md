# It's hard...

To keep focused, inspiration helps a lot.

With the things below I keep myself focused and centered.

> **Inspiration is like networking and not like building a pyramid. Sharing in a network doubles the knowledge. Sharing a brick to build a pyramid is cutting it in half. Double the knowledge, insights and inspiration.**

I love being in the flow of things. The images, YouTube videos and music helps a lot.
